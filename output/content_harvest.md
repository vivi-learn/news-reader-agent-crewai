BANGKOK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Landmines that maimed at least six Thai soldiers in recent clashes along the Thailand-Cambodia border were likely newly planted, experts said on Thursday, raising fears of renewed violence between the neighbours.

Analysts believe the mines, which are of Russian-made PMN-2 design, were laid within the last week, based on soil and vegetation disturbance around the blast sites near the Preah Vihear temple, a UNESCO World Heritage site claimed by both countries.

"The patterns and conditions suggest recent emplacement," said military analyst Dr. Somchai Ratanawaraha. "These are not leftover mines from past conflicts; they were placed deliberately to escalate tensions."

Thailand's foreign ministry has summoned Cambodia's ambassador to Bangkok for an explanation. Phnom Penh denied involvement, saying it would investigate the allegations.

This incident marks the third reported mine-related injury in two months, amid a series of border skirmishes that have killed at least three soldiers and displaced dozens of villagers.

The United Nations has urged restraint from both sides and called for an immediate ceasefire.

PEKAN, Malaysia, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Thailand and Cambodia signed an agreement to cease hostilities at the ASEAN summit on Tuesday, according to Malaysia's foreign minister, in a bid to halt weeks of bloody skirmishes along their shared border.

"We welcome the understanding reached between the Kingdom of Thailand and the Kingdom of Cambodia," Malaysia's Foreign Minister Anwar Ibrahim told reporters in Pekan.

Under the deal, both sides agreed to pull back troops five kilometres from the disputed frontier around the Preah Vihear temple and establish a joint border committee to resolve remaining issues peacefully.

While welcomed by ASEAN leaders, the accord has not been fully implemented on the ground, with both armies accusing the other of minor ceasefire violations since midnight.

The fighting, sparked by long-standing territorial claims and nationalist sentiment, has killed at least five soldiers and forced over 10,000 civilians to flee border villages.

Analysts say renewed diplomacy and involvement of ASEAN special envoys may be crucial to preventing a wider escalation.

## Article 3: Cracked truce: Thailand-Cambodia border fight far from over

**Full Article Text:**  
On Oct. 14, the Thai and Cambodian militaries ostensibly agreed to a ceasefire at the annual ASEAN summit in Malaysia. Yet on the ground, sporadic firefights have continued near the Preah Vihear temple, an ancient sanctuary perched atop disputed land.

Local villagers describe nights shattered by artillery and mortar rounds, with both sides blaming the other for renewed shelling.

"It’s like waking up in a nightmare," said Somnuk Phan, a villager from Ban Sung, located just five kilometres from the temple. "Every time we think it’s over, the guns start again."

Experts point to deep-seated nationalistic fervour stoked by domestic politics in both capitals, suggesting that neither government wants to appear weak ahead of upcoming elections.

"This has become a proxy for broader geopolitical rivalries," said Dr. Lin Mei, a regional security specialist. "China and the U.S. are both vying for influence in ASEAN, and this border conflict is one arena where that playbook is visible."

Human rights groups have sounded the alarm over the displacement of more than 12,000 civilians and damage to cultural heritage at the Preah Vihear complex, a UNESCO World Heritage site.

Despite promises from ASEAN leaders, aid agencies report logistical challenges in delivering relief due to ongoing security concerns.

With neither side showing willingness to de-escalate beyond verbal commitments, analysts warn the situation could deteriorate further if diplomatic efforts stall.
