## üö® Today's Lead Story

### Starlink Unit Could Lead SpaceX IPO as Soon as 2025
SpaceX‚Äôs satellite-internet arm, Starlink, may be the first to test public markets, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Alex Potter. A standalone Starlink listing could unlock investor value ahead of a full SpaceX float, particularly if additional regulatory approvals in Europe and Asia arrive and recurring revenues reach critical mass. Potter warns that macroeconomic volatility and pending FAA licensing for crewed lunar flights could delay or truncate timing, but a late-2025 window remains plausible.

## üéØ Editor's Analysis

**Key Themes Today:**  
- Timing Uncertainty: Projections span late 2025 to mid-2026 based on variable milestones.  
- Control vs. Capital: Musk‚Äôs desire to retain private control clashes with growing funding needs.  
- Spin-Off Strategy: Starlink emerges as a leading candidate for an initial public spin-off.  
- Regulatory Gatekeepers: FAA approvals for expanded launch operations and crewed flights are pivotal.

**What This Means:**  
Investors should prepare for volatility in private-market valuations as tender offers and secondary trades set benchmarks. A Starlink spin-off could offer the first real public access to SpaceX‚Äôs growth story, potentially at a premium multiple. Full-company IPO risks hinge on delivering on Starship ambitions and navigating evolving aerospace regulations.

**Looking Ahead:**  
- Monitor FAA license decisions on Starship and lunar mission tests.  
- Track Starlink‚Äôs monthly recurring revenue and break-even forecasts.  
- Watch for new tender offers or pre-IPO funding rounds signaling management‚Äôs intent to open the cap table.
